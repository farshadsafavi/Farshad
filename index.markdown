My name is Farshad Safavi. I have Master of computer engineering from University of Toronto. I earned my bachelor of Electrical Engineering from Carleton University. I am very interested to research on Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning.<br>
I am a computer engineer who has a great passion about building software products using Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have developed and deployed various large scaled software products. <br>
The main purpose of this page is to introduce you to number of projects I am very interested in and the project I have accomplished in the past. </font></div>
