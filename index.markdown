My name is Farshad Safavi. I have Master of computer engineering from University of Toronto. I earned my bachelor of Electrical Engineering from Carleton University. I am very interested to research on Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning.<br>
I am a computer engineer who has a great passion about building software products using Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have developed and deployed various large scaled software products. I am currently developing software to architect different deep learning models including convolutional neural networks(CNN) , recurrent neural networks(RNN) and generative adversarial networks(GAN) using Python and PyTorch. Iâ€™d love to combine my passion for AI with my software development skills to build smart products of the future.
Skills: Python, Java, C++, OOP, PyTorch. <br>
The main purpose of this page is to introduce you to number of projects I am very interested in and the project I have accomplished in the past. </div>
